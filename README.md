# Hi there! üëã

I aspire to be a scientist in Finance, starting as a self-taught developer and learning new things at a fast pace with the help of various GPT models. As a day-to-day quantitative developer, I'm passionate about developing trading algorithms, building fun or anarchic stuff on blockchain, and collaborating on innovative projects in the statistical finance and algorithmic trading technology sectors. üìàüíª In between coding, I shred my electric guitar and headbang; it sometimes helps fix errors.

I'm an Economics graduate from LSE with a background in Machine Learning Programming from the UTM. I specialize in quantitative trading, machine learning modeling, algorithmic trading development, multichain blockchain development, and consulting for Web3 projects.
